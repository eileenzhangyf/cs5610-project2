## Project Objective
In this project, we developed a web application that aims to help users keep track of their groceries. This app allows users to keep track of both remaining groceries at home and shopping list for future. We have utilized tech stacks of Node.js and Express for the backend and set up a MongoDB database to allow CRUD operations.
