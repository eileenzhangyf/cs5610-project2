## Project Objective

In this project, we developed a web application that aims to help users keep track of their groceries. This app allows users to keep track of both remaining groceries (storage list) at home and shopping list for future. Users are also allowed to sort the storage list based on price, quantity, purchased date, and remaining days. We have utilized tech stacks of Node.js and Express for the backend and set up a MongoDB database with 3 collections.
